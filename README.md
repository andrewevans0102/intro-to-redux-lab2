# intro-to-redux-lab

This is the project that goes alongside my lab on using Redux. This project walks you through a basic project and adds Redux incrementally. The project's goal is to explain the basic patterns that make Redux so powerful. The project also has some fun as its a small site about [The Mandalorian](https://www.starwars.com/series/the-mandalorian).

The way you can progress through this lab is to start with the initial project in the `start` folder.

Then, follow the READMEs in the folders in this order:

1. [start](./start)
2. [redux-setup](./redux-setup)
3. [redux-actions](./redux-actions)
4. [redux-http](./redux-http)

Starting with the `redux-setup` folder, the README's will guide you through what should be done. The folders are a "complete" stage of that phase of the lab.

The `ContactPage` component that is in all of the projects makes a POST call to a [hosted site](https://intro-to-redux-lab.web.app/). When working through that section, you can pull up the site alongside your local project to see the HTTP calls being recieved.
